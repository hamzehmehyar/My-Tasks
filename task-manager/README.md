* drawing a wireframes for the website we are making:

    By the way a wireframe helps us to visualize or imagine the website before starting to implement it with the code.

 - let's start first with the Home page

    **Header section**

    this Home page that you see contains a header section which includes the logo and a navigation little bar in the middle that tells us where we are and we can use this navigation bar to switch between the Home page and the About page.

    **task input section**

    then we have a task input section which the user can enter his tasks in the box and submit it.

    **tasks tracking section**

    then we have a task tracking section so the user can track his submitted tasks, so every tasks he submits it appears in this tracking section.

    **Footer section**

   - header section to show the logo and the navigation bar which tells you that you are in the about page.

   - a personal section which gives a professional paragraph about the person who we are introducing

   - and beside that personal section on the right side we have a personal card or a form that shows a picture of that person and his name above, and also the email and phone number.

   - lastly we have a footer section that will contain a copyright information and a short message.
